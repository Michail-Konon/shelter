                        Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our 
                        hands and statistics show that only 20% of them 
                        will find a family. The others will continue to 
                        live with us and will be waiting for a lucky chance 
                        to become dearly loved.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-text">
                        We feed our wards with the best food and make sure 
                        that they do not get sick, feel comfortable (including psychologically) 
                        and well. We are supported by 87 volunteers and 28 employees of various 
                        skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the shelter staff. 
                        Taking care of the animals, they become attached to the pets and would 
                        hardly ever leave them alone.
